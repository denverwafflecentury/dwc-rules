## Rules/Logistics/Disclaimers

**This is an informal, unsupported event not affiliated with Waffle House or any other waffle establishment. Participation in this ride is at your own risk. Please ride with a friend, assume the need to be self-sufficient in the event of any mechanical issues, and have a plan to get home if shit hits the fan**

The route takes us to all 5 Denver-area Waffle Houses. Participants will need to eat at least 1 waffle (or hash brown as a gluten-free option) at each location. These must be consumed at the Waffle House - they cannot be eaten on the move. There's gonna be a lot of us filtering through these places throughout the day. **BE COOL, TIP WELL!!**

The provided route maximizes the use of bike infrastructure and takes us over the magical 100 mile mark, but does involve riding on public roads with traffic. If you feel the route is asking you to do something stupid, use your best judgement and stay safe.

Finally, we're lucky to be able to do something this stupid and gluttonous. Please consider matching your waffle tab for the day with a donation to [Food Bank of the Rockies](https://www.foodbankrockies.org/).

If we get a crazy amount of interest, we may need to break up into pace groups to ensure we're not overloading the first location right at the beginning - watch your emails closer to the event date for any changes to start time(s).
